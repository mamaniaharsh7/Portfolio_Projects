# Revenue Analysis

#### Data Source --> (SQL Dump attached in a file above)

<br/>

## Problem Statement :

> This case study is based on a computer hardware business, *‘AtliQ Hardware’*,
> which supplies Hardware Peripherals to various clients pan India, but is now
> facing challenges in dynamically changing market. They have a head-office in
> Delhi, regional offices in many states. We have their sales data with over
> 150,000 Transactions.

> Sales Director is having a lot of struggle tracking where the business is
> failing. Regional managers keep painting a rosy picture when summoned by Sales
> Director. They give him big Excel files. So he doesn’t know what's happening at
> ground level.

<br/>

He wants to know things like :

-   *Revenue Trends*

-   *Revenue Breakdown by Years and Months, Customers, Products.*

-   *Top 5 Customers and Products*

-   *Weakest Regions where Sales is declining*

-   *an Interactive Dashboard. (where, if he click on some region, he gets all
    data for that region)*

Thus, wants to take **Sales related decisions backed by** **DATA**!

<br/>

## Final Dashboards:-

### Tools used :

- Here, I've used *_MySQL_* for performing my Analysis on the available SQL Data Dump.
- To develop the interactive Dashboard, I've used *_TABLEAU_*.
