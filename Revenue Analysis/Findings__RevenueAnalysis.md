1.  So, the results show a clear **'decline'** in the Revenue every year. (along
    with Sales Quantity)

|   | **Year** | **Revenue**      | **Sales_Qty** |
|---|----------|------------------|---------------|
|   | 2017     | **9,28,82,653**  | 2,34,462      |
|   | 2018     | **41,36,87,163** | 9,97,497      |
|   | 2019     | **33,60,19,102** | 8,47,083      |
|   | 2020     | **14,22,24,545** | 3,50,240      |

- For ‘2017’ data from '2017-10-04' ... monthly avg for 3 given months =
    '30,960,884.33' ...so, on same rate, yearly Revenue would ideally be =
    '37,15,30,611.96' (37Cr)

- For ‘2020’ data till '2020-06-26' ... monthly avg for 6 given months =
    '23,704,090.83' ...so, on same rate, yearly Revenue would ideally be =
    '28,44,49,089.96' (28.4Cr)

<br/>
2.  This implies,

- from 2017 (estimated 37Cr) to 2018 (41.4Cr) year-on-year growth --\> 0.11346
    (**11% incline**)

- from 2018 (41.4Cr) to 2019 (33.6Cr) year-on-year growth --\> -0.18774 (**19%
    decline**)

- from 2019 (33.6Cr) to 2020 (estimated 28.4Cr) year-on-year growth --\>
    \-0.15347 *(***15% decline**)

- Which means on an Average, (-0.07591) **'7.5% decline'** in Revenue every year.

1.  They have presence in **14 cities**, which has mostly remained **constant**
    over years.

|   | **Yearr** | **No_of_cities_served** |
|---|-----------|-------------------------|
|   | 2017      | **14**                  |

|   | 2020      | **14**                  |

<br/>
2.  The **Top 5 Revenue Generating Cities** have nearly remained the same (and
    in the same order as well) throughout the Years.

|   |   | **Rnk** | **City**      |
|---|---|---------|---------------|
|   |   | 1       | **Delhi NCR** |
|   |   | 2       | **Mumbai**    |
|   |   | 3       | **Ahmedabad** |
|   |   | 4       | **Bhopal**    |
|   |   | 5       | **Nagpur**    |

- Thus, **Delhi NCR** being their major cash-cow, which tops the list with
    hefty margin every year.

> ### \*\*\*\*\* **\#3 'PRODUCT-WISE PERFORMANCE'** \*\*\*\*\*
<br/>
1.  Firstly, their inventory includes **'279' different types of products**.

<br/>
2.  Out of the '279' total types of products in the inventory, not all types
    have been sold each year... there's been lot of fluctuations!

|   | **Yearr** | **Types of Products sold** |
|---|-----------|----------------------------|
|   | 2017      | **208**                    |
|   | 2018      | **264**                    |
|   | 2019      | **238**                    |
|   | 2020      | **197**                    |

- Essentially, it appears that with every passing year, lot of products have
    gone **unsold/been discontinued.**

- Given the fact that we have only **3 months** of data from **'2017'**, still
    there were **'208'** different products sold

- While, even after having **6 months** of Data from **'2020'**, only a mere
    **'197'** types of products have made their way.

<br/>
3.  We see that, the **Product Prices** range from :

- **'Rs.0.9024'** (when 41-Qty were sold for Rs.37) to

- **'Rs.5056'(when 1-Qty were sold for Rs.5056) !!**

- **Also, they've fulfilled orders ranging from 'Rs.5' upto 'Rs.15,10,944'
    !!**

<br/>
4.  **Categorizing** the products based on prices:

|   | **Price_Range**  | **No_of_Unique_Products_in_this_Range** | **Revenue_Generated_from_this_Range** | **Percentage_contribution_to_Revenue** |
|---|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|   | **0 to 500**     | **298**                                 | 267066724                             | **27.1185**                            |
|   | **500 to 1000**  | **208**                                 | 188650023                             | **19.1559**                            |
|   | **1000 to 1500** | **138**                                 | 206595481                             | **20.9781**                            |
|   | **1500 to 2000** | **101**                                 | 153620605                             | **15.599**                             |
|   | **2000 to 2500** | **63**                                  | 87150545                              | **8.8494**                             |
|   | **2500 to 3000** | **35**                                  | 27710999                              | **2.8138**                             |
|   | **3000 to 3500** | **21**                                  | 14573147                              | **1.4798**                             |
|   | **3500 to 4000** | **14**                                  | 10425999                              | **1.0587**                             |
|   | **4000 to 4500** | **10**                                  | 28985816                              | **2.9433**                             |
|   | **4500 to 5000** | **3**                                   | 18976                                 | **0.0019**                             |
|   | **5000 to 5500** | **1**                                   | 15148                                 | **0.0015**                             |

- Thus, we see that the **most 'economical' price ranges** contribute the most
    to the **Revenue**!!

    - As, the we keep going up in the 'price range', their contribution to the
        Revenue keeps going down. (**Inversely** related)

- Also, the good thing is that, these **economic yet lucrative** categories
    enjoy the **most No. Of Products.**

    - which implies good sense of **pricing** and **placement**

- We notice that though the total no. of 'Unique' products was only **'338'**,
    but if we try to Sum up the 'No_of_Unique_Products_in_this_Range' column, it
    goes way **beyond 338**...How's that possible?

    - Well, maybe some products have been introduced with **different prices
        at different point of times**, so they get counted in all those
        categories of 'Price_Range'.

5.  **‘Own Brand’** vs **‘Distribution’** products:

|---|-----------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|   | 2017      | 192730             | 161913                 | **84.0103**                   | 30817                           | **15.9897**                   | 34272017                         | 9706266                             |
|   | 2018      | 819210             | 665248                 | **81.2060**                   | 153962                          | **18.7940**                   | 161756295                        | 51317068                            |
|   | 2019      | 706455             | 495559                 | **70.1473**                   | 210896                          | **29.8527**                   | 126207845                        | 55198050                            |
|   | 2020      | 291468             | 190567                 | **65.3818**                   | 100901                          | **34.6182**                   | 47576491                         | 29818192                            |

- Over the years, we can say that, out of **'100'** products sold, on an
    Average **'75'** would be **'Own Brand'** and **'25'** would be of
    **'Distribution'** Type.

- So, it's a no-brainer that their 'Own Brand' sums up to the major part of
    the 'Total Revenue'!

- On an avg, **'Own Brand'** products generate **'2.5x'** more **Revenue**
    than **'Dsitribution'** products.

Thus, we see that : (There's **no clear winner!**)

- Since, the 'Percent contribution' of any product to that year's revenue has
    never been more than **'9.5%** and **6.3%**' ==\> no single product has been
    a major contributor to the Revenue, it is **accumulated from small amounts**
    generated by **all products**.

- Mostly all the products are from **'Own Brand'** ==\> 'Own Brand' products
    are major contributors to the **Revenue**, and hardly any from
    'Distribution' products.

- There are hardly any products that have **repeated** themselves over years!
    ==\> this goes on to say that, it's **difficult to predict** which product
    will do well in a given year... it's totally **random** --\> which will be
    very **difficult** to plan **inventory**, **pricing** and **offers** on
    products.

- only 3 products have featured Twice :

    - “**Prod239**” **'2nd'** in 2017, **'5th'** in 2018 ==\> **'3.82%'** and
**'3.39%'** of Revenue Contribution in respective years.

    - “**Prod040**” **'1st'** in 2018, **'2nd'** in 2019 ==\> **'6.30%'** and
**'4.27%'** of Revenue Contribution in respective years.

    - “**Prod065**” **'3rd'** in 2019, **'4th'** in 2020 ==\> **'3.76%'** and
**'4.05%'** of Revenue Contribution in respective years.

- And, only 1 Product has featured Thrice :

    - “**Prod053**” **'5th'** in 2017, **'3rd'** in 2018, **'4th'** in 2019 ==\>
**'3.22%'**, **'3.74%'** and **'3.07%'** of Revenue Contribution in respective
years.

> ### \*\*\*\*\* **\#4 'CUSTOMER-WISE PERFORMANCE'** \*\*\*\*\*
<br/>
1.  Over the lifetime it has served only **"38"** Unique Customers!

<br/>
2.  Annually Repeating/New Customers :

|   | **Yearr** | **DISTINCT customer_code** |
|---|-----------|----------------------------|
|   | 2017      | 38                         |
|   | 2018      | 38                         |
|   | 2019      | 38                         |
|   | 2020      | 38                         |

- So, since the 'Total Unique Customers' served in "entire lifetime" of the
    dataset are '38'

- and, the total 'Total Unique Customers' served "per year" are also'38', for
    all the Years : 2017 to 2020

- We can say that : **Each year, it has served 'ALL' of the 'SAME' 38
    customers.**

- No new customers acquired in any year! --**0 New Customer Acquisition.**

- No previous customer unserved in any year! --**100% Customer Retention.**

|   | 2019     | 847083             | 651750                          | **76.9405**                         | 195333                        | **23.0595**                         | 257563281                           | 78455821                          |
|   | 2020     | 350240             | 261684                          | **74.7156**                         | 88556                         | **25.2844**                         | 113136780                           | 29087765                          |

- Over the years, we can say that, out of **'100'** products sold,

    - on an Average **'76'** would be through "**BRICK & MORTAR**" stores &
        **'24'** would be through "**E-COMMERCE**" Channels.

- So, it's a no-brainer that their **'BRICK & MORTAR'** stores are the major
    contributors of their 'Total **Revenue'**!

    - On an avg, 'BRICK & MORTAR' stores generate "**3.13x**" more Revenue
        than 'E-COMMERCE' Channels.

- Best bet to continuously increase revenue and be **future-proof** is to
    increase their efforts on **'Online Presence'** through **'Digital
    Marketing'** and flourish over **'E-COMMERCE'** !!

- The list remains nearly **consistent**, with most pertinent customers being
    :

    - **"Electricalsara Stores"**

    - "Electricalslytical"

    - "Excel Stores"

    - "Premium Stores"

- The best customer, which has always topped the list by a huge margin is :
    **"Electricalsara Stores"**

    - contributing on an Average **"42%" to the Annual Revenue**

- If we see the list after "Electricalsara Stores", all others' contribution
    is merely in Single Digits, **mostly around '5%'**

    - this shows that, the remaining Revenue after the contribution from
        "Electricalsara Stores", is **shared in small parts** among lot of
        customers.

- Mostly all the Customers in the list are 'BRICK & MORTAR' stores...
    "**Electricalslytical**" is the lone **'E-COMMERCE'** customer.
