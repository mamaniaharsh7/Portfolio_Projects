> ### \*\*\*\*\* **\#4 'INDIA SPECIFIC STATS'** \*\*\*\*\*
<br/> 

For **India** :

   -   **lowest death rate** was *1.0860%*...went roughly around *3.5958%* at
        **peak**.

   -   at **Max**, only *2.3644%* of the Indian Population has been
        **affected**, till today!!

   -   after *62 cases*, we had the **1st Death**, on *11th_March_2020*.

   -   currently if you're in **INDIA**, and **infected** with Covid, there is
        **just 1.3% chance** that u may **die** of it!

> ### \*\*\*\*\* **\#5 'THE BEGINNING OF THE END'** \*\*\*\*\*
<br/> 

**23-01-2020** :

   -   **Cases** started on *23rd_Jan_2020.*

   -   On the 1st day only *98 cases* were detected around the *world*. (or
        maybe the reporting of cases started that day!)

   -   **Deaths** also started on *23rd_Jan_2020.*

   -   On the 1st day only *1 death* out of the 98 cases detected around the
        *world*.
<br/>
<br/>

\#====================================================================================
<br/>
<br/>
   
> ### \*\*\*\*\* **\#6 'THE PEAK!'** \*\*\*\*\*
<br/> 

MAXIMUM of Cases, Deaths, Mortality Rate:

   -   **Maximum Total_New_Cases** on a single day, around the world were
        **9,05,932**, which was on **28th April 2021**.

   -   **Maximum Total_Deaths** on a single day, around the world were
        **17,977**, which was on **20th January 2021**.

   -   **Maximum Mortality_Rate** on a single day, around the world was
        **28.3687%**, which was on **24th February 2020**.

   -   How the surprising **28**%? – On that day, *Total_New_Cases* were *564*
        & *Total_Deaths* that day were *160*. This doesn’t mean 160 people died
        out of the 564 cases that day. Others who *might’ve contracted earlier*,
        *but succumbed that day* were also counted to *Total_Deaths* for that
        day. Also, we know that *no cure/treatment* were known then, so
        conditions were *more vulnerable*.

> ### \*\*\*\*\* **\#7 'PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION INFECTED'** \*\*\*\*\*
<br/> 

Countries who had it worst:

   -   When comparing the **Highest_Percentage_of_Population_Infected** at any
        point of time (till date), surprisingly, **Seychelles** ranks **1st**.

   -   With its **Total_Population** of **98,910** ; at **Max** the
        **Total_cases** were **20,230** at a point of time in past

   -   Thus, **20.4529% of its Population** was infected which stands the
        **highest percentage** in the **world**.

   -   [This is *not* by *number* of people, but by *%* of infected people to
        its *population*, hence, many *small countries* have topped the list.]

   -   big countries here are :

        1.  **Israel**, **USA**.

        2.  European countries mostly like : **UK**, **France**, **Netherland**,
            **Spain**, **Belgium**.

        3.  These have all reached **at least** above **10%** for once.

   -   **India** is positioned **106th**, with **2.3644%** as **highest ever**
        till date.
