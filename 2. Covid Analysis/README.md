# Covid Analysis
<br/>


#### Data Source --> [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
<br/>
<br/>

## Motivation:
<br/>

> Throughout this catastrophical crisis, the international statistics community has continued to work together, in partnership with national statistical offices and systems around the world to ensure that the best quality data and statistics are available to support decision making during and after the crisis. With this project, I have tried to give a small flavor of that cooperation.
<br/>

> Being constantly bombarded with stats like Death Tolls, Mortality Rates, Infection Rate, etc... I got really curious about generating such insights on my own.
> How could I not!
<br/>

> The Data that I've pulled from the forementioned [source](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) consists of 1,10,000+ records from '01-01-2020' to '03-09-2021' spanning across all the continents and countries, with fields like date, population, cases, deaths, vaccinations, etc.
> In the Dataset, for some countries the number of confirmed deaths is a bit lower than the true number of deaths. This is because of limited testing and challenges in the attribution of the cause of death.
<br/>

> With new statistical records being set on an almost weekly basis, the statistics I've presented in this project are just the tip of the iceberg. I encourage you to visit the [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), where you’ll find a wealth of high-quality data and information.

### I've tried to generate insights and trends related to:

-   *Mortality Rate over time*

-   *Percentage Population infected*

-   *Running counter for Number of Vaccinations per day for each country*

-   *Safest and Worst Affected Regions*

-   *and finally, an Interactive Dashboard to sum up my findings*

Thus, I've tried to present a factful account of the ground-zero data. Although I've covered a wide range of topics in this project, a consistency of message is clear – "this
is an unprecedented crisis, and no aspect of our lives is immune!"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Project Workflow :
-   Pulled live data from the Website in the form of CSV files.
-   Used *_EXCEL_* to clean the Data from NULL Values and partition the Dataset.
-   Then, I've plugged the **CSV** files to *_SQL SERVER_* in order to perform my Analysis.
-   To develop the interactive Dashboard, I've used *_TABLEAU_* and published it on Tableau Public.

(Wear your *_MASKS_* :mask: , *_SANITIZE_* well :palms_up_together: !!)

> - In times like this, *HOPE* is a powerful healer. Mankind stands united in its struggle against the Covid 19 pandemic and life will surely *triumph*.
> - As the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, said: *_“With common cause for common sense and facts, we can defeat COVID-19 -- and build a healthier, more equitable, just and resilient world”._*
