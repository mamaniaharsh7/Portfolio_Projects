# Covid Analysis
<br/>


#### Data Source --> [https://www.kaggle.com/htagholdings/property-sales](https://www.kaggle.com/htagholdings/property-sales).

## Motivation:
<br/>

> my motivation
<br/>

> about the dataset
<br/>
<br/>

### I've tried to generate insights and trends related to:

-   *Trends in AVERAGE PRICE over years*

-   *Best and Worst Performing POSTCODES*

-   *Revenue Contribution of various Property types*

-   *PRICES to afford '1 BEDROOM' in each property type*


Thus, I've tried to present a factful account of the ground-zero data. Although I've covered a wide range of topics in this project, a consistency of message is clear â€“ "this
is an unprecedented crisis, and no aspect of our lives is immune!"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Project Workflow:
-   Pulled live data from the Website in the form of CSV files.
-   Used *_EXCEL_* to clean the Data from NULL Values.
-   Then, I've plugged the **CSV** files to *_MySQL_* in order to perform my Analysis.
<br/>

Suggestion and Improvements are always welcome! :grin:
